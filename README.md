# macro_and_confidence

## Overview 
Behavorial finance has been a hot topic explored by academia. Does herd mentality impact global markets? Can there be potential warning signs for future corrections? Many of these answers are ambiguous, however we know for certain that no individual can tell the future with certainty. Our group has presented our findings to key questions that we have listed below. 

We have obtained data for our findings using API's from Quandl, and Yahoo Finance. In addition, we have also utilized the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). We have obtained confidence indicators utilizing Yale's School of Management stock market indicies. The confidence indicators are results of surveys given to individual and institutional investors. 

The one year confidence index illustrates the percent of the population expecting an increase in the Dow in the coming year. The valuation confidence index illustrates the percent of the population who think that the market is not too high. The crash confidence index illustrates the percent of the population who attach little probability to a stock market crash in the next six months.


## What is the general confidence level of the market?
  1. The mean individual confidence level is 76.5 and the mean institutional is 77.6. This tells us that the outlook on the market is generally positive. Over time, the confidence of the stock market for both institutions and individuals has been in a downtrend. 

  2. Institutional Investors tend to remain more confident over time with a major crossover showing this reality in 2007. Prior to 2007, individual confidence was consistently greater. Our team speculates that this can potentially be due to individuals having a negative sentiment towards the market after the dot.com bubble and Great Recession. 
   
  3. Institutional value confidence has reached the same low levels witnessed in 2000, which indicates a stronger beleif in market prices being high. Individual value confidence is reaching these levels. Both are clearly making lower lows.
 
  4. Institutional and individual crash confidences reached levels similar to 2000, 2001, 2009, & 2011, indicating that they believe a crash is more likely. This bounced and rose quickly as in previous instances, but neither the institutional or individual confidence levels have reached the mean levels of confidence, 35 and 32 respectively, yet.



## Do confidence levels in the upper quartile and lower quartile indicate a coming market reversal?

  1. While doing our analysis, we found that the upper quartile of confidence data was all concentrated in the years 2001-2006 and the lower quartile of confidence data was all concentrated in the years 2014-2020. The mean confidence level for institutions in the upper quartile was 86.26, the min was 81.11 and the max was 92.52. The mean confidence level for individuals in the upper quartile was 89.38, the min was 83.93 and the max was 95.62. The mean confidence level for institutions in the lower quartile was 69.49, the min was 61.54 and the max was 74.02. The mean confidence level for individuals in the lower quartile was 65.80, the min was 59.75 and the max was 70.71. 
  2. When we compared these confidence levels to the DOW jones, it becomes clear that there is a negative correlation between the DJI and the confidence of institutional and individual investors. This could be due to greater market volatility in recent years, or painful memories of prior market instability. Therefore rather than indicating a market reversal, the confidence levels better serve to help us understand the effects of historical market performance on individual and instituitonal confidence.

## What is the performance of the Dow when confidence indicators shift? 

  1. If you were only to invest in the Dow Jones Industrial Average when institutional confidence levels exceed 70%, you would have a performance of roughly 185% your initial investment. However, if you were only to invest when insitutional confidence was below 70%, you would only have roughly a 15% return on your investment. We can reasonably expect that the Dow performs better when insitutional confidence is greater. Currently, institutional confidence is roughly 61%.

  2. If you were only to invest in the Dow when individual confidence exceeds 70%, your return would be roughly 160%. This metric is slighly below the instutional figure meaning that individual investors are not as likely to predict market performance as well. An interesting statistic we found was if you invested only when institutional confidence was below 70%, you would still generate a return of roughly 41%. This indicates that individual investors are less likely to predict market performance as institutional investors. 

## What do macroeconomic measures tell us about the market's performance, and how do they compare to confidence levels?
  1. In recent years the volatility in macroeconomic indicators associated with market events has increased each cycle. This is evident in the 

## How bad does confidence have to be for things to really be bad?

## Is there a dislocation between market sentiment and the realiity of the economy?





## Economic Analysis 

1. Are there relationships with the SP500 and the GDP? 
2. What relationships are there with the SP500 P/E with the overall economy? 
3. Does over extention of the SP500 PE ratio indicate a potential correction?
