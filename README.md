##What is the general confidence level of the market?
  1. The general confidence of the stock market is positive, with the mean individual confidence level at 76.5 and mean institutional at 77.62. Over time, the confidence of the stock market for both institutions and individuals has been in a downtrend.
  2. Institutional Investors tend to remain more confident over time with a major crossover showing this reality in 2007, prior to which individual confidence was consistently greater. 
  3. Institutional value confidence has reached the same low levels witnessed in 2000, which indicates a stronger confidence in market prices being high. Individual value confidence is reaching these levels. Both are clearly making lower lows.
  4. Institutional and individual crash confidences reached levels similar to 2000, 2001, 2009, & 2011, indicating that they believe a crash is more likely. This bounced and rose quickly as in previous instances, but neither the institutional or individual confidence levels have reached the mean levels of confidence, 35 and 32 respectively, yet.
